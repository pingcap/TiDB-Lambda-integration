# TiDB Cloud + AWS Cloudformation Bookshop Demo

## Introduction

Welcome to the bookshop demo! This project demonstrates how to use AWS CloudFormation, Secrets Manager, API Gateway, and Lambda Functions to create a fully-functional online bookshop using TiDB Cloud as the database-as-a-service (DBaaS). The Secrets Manager service is used to store database-related details, the API Gateway is used to handle HTTP request routes, and the Lambda Functions are used to handle requests and query data from the TiDB Cloud database.

AWS CloudFormation provides a common language to describe and provision all the infrastructure resources in your environment in a safe, repeatable way. This means that all AWS services used in this demo, including Secrets Manager, API Gateway, and Lambda Functions, will be created using CloudFormation.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use this project, you will need the following:

- An [AWS account](https://portal.aws.amazon.com)
- Access to the AWS CloudFormation, Secrets Manager, API Gateway, Lambda services, S3 and IAM Roles
- An account with [TiDB Cloud](https://pingcap.com/products/tidbcloud/)

## Before you begin

Create a [TiDB Cloud](https://tidbcloud.com/) account and get your free trial cluster(Serverless Tier).

## 🚀 Setting up the demo by Cloudformation template

To set up the bookshop demo by Cloudformation, follow these steps:

1. Download the [latest release assets](https://github.com/shczhen/aws-cloudformation-bookshop-test/releases/latest) to your local machine.
2. In the assets, you will find the file `index.zip`, this is the Lambda function code that will be used in the demo. Upload this file to an S3 bucket in your AWS account. Do remember to note down the S3 bucket name and the file name, and make sure the S3 bucket is the same region as your next CloudFormation stack.
3. In the assets, you will find two files: `cloudformation_template.yml` and `cloudformation_template.json`. These files contain the AWS CloudFormation template that will be used to create all of the necessary resources for the demo, including the Secrets Manager, API Gateway, and Lambda Functions. You can use either the `.yml` or `.json` file, depending on your preference.
4. In the AWS Management Console, navigate to the CloudFormation service.
5. Click the "Create Stack" button.
6. Select the "Upload a template file" option, and choose the CloudFormation template file (`either cloudformation_template.yml` or `cloudformation_template.json`) that you want to use.
7. Follow the prompts to complete the stack creation process. This may take a few minutes.

### 1. Create a Secrets Manager service

Visit Secrets Manager service in AWS Management Console, and click `Store a new secret` button.

Input `TiDBDatabase`, `TiDBUser`, `TiDBPassword`, `TiDBHost` and `TiDBPort` which are the database-related details of your TiDB Cloud cluster. You can find these details in your TiDB Cloud cluster dashboard.

Do remember input `autogenerated/cloudformation/tidbcloud` as the secret name, which will be used in the Lambda function.

### 2. Create an IAM Role for Lambda

We need to use Secrets Manager in Lambda function, so we need to create an IAM Role for Lambda to access the Secrets Manager service.

Visit IAM service in AWS Management Console, and click `Roles` button.

Click `Create role` button, and select `AWS service` as the trusted entity, and select `Lambda` as the use case.

Click `Next: Permissions` button, and search `secretsmanager` in the search box, and select `SecretsManagerReadWrite` policy; Search `lambda` and select `AWSLambdaBasicExecutionRole` policy.

Click `Next` button, and input `LambdaSecretsManagerRole` as the role name, and click `Create role` button.

### 3. Create Lambda functions

We will create 4 Lambda functions in this demo.

#### 3.1 Create a Lambda function to get all books / get a book by id

Visit Lambda service in AWS Management Console, and click `Create function` button.

Select `Author from scratch` as the blueprint, and input `getBookFunction` as the function name, and select `Node.js 18x` as the runtime.

Select `Change default execution role` - `Use an existing role`, and select the `LambdaSecretsManagerRole` role we created in the previous step.

Click `Create function` button.

Click `Upload a .zip file` button, and upload the `index.zip` file in the latest release assets.

Click `Save` button.

Edit `Runtime settings` of the Lambda function, and set `Handler` to `getBookHandler.handler`. Click `Save` button.

Choose `Configuration` tab - `General configuration`, and set `Timeout` to `30 sec`. Click `Save` button.

> We build the Lambda function in the `index.zip` file, and you can also build it by yourself. See [README](aws-lambda-cloudformation/README.md) for more details.

#### 3.2 Create a Lambda function to post a new book / post initial books

Visit Lambda service in AWS Management Console, and click `Create function` button.

## Using the demo

Once the stack has been created, you can use the demo as follows:

Visit API Gateway service in AWS Management Console, and click `TiDBCloudApiGatewayV2` API.

Check the `Invoke URL` in the `Overview` page, and copy it. This is the API endpoint.

Use API test tools like Postman to test the API.

> We will use cURL in the following examples. You can also use Postman or other tools.

### Init mock books

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"count":100}' https://<your-api-endpoint>/book/init
```

### Get all books

```bash
curl https://<your-api-endpoint>/book
```

### Get a book by id

```bash
curl https://<your-api-endpoint>/book/1
```

### Update a book by id

```bash
curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "title": "Book Title(updated)" }' https://<your-api-endpoint>/book/1
```

### Post a new book

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "title": "Book Title", "type": "Test", "publishAt": "2022-12-15T21:01:49.000Z", "stock": 123, "price": 12.34, "authors": "Test Test" }' https://<your-api-endpoint>/book
```

### Delete a book by id

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://<your-api-endpoint>/book/1
```
